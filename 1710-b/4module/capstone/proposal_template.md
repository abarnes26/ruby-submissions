#### Capstone Proposal

#### Title: Solar Carbon Debt Calc (working title)

### Pitch

An application to simplify the tracking of total carbon debt generated by Solar Installers.

### Problem

If you want to be taken seriously as a renewable energy creator in today's market, an environmental impact report is a necessity. Given the competative nature of the solar market, most companies are doing well to only keep their doors open and often don't have the resources to generate such a report.

### Solution

By combining publicly available data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and data from on site operations, a fairly accurate estimate of carbon impact can be calculated.  This applications aims to simplify that process and give the business owners easy organization of branches and projects.  The application will generate real time analytics on carbon impact based on the data in the application.

### MVP

* Must have MVP: The user will be able to create and manage branches (offices), within each branch individual projects can be created and managed.  NREL data will be applied to each specific project location to generate an estimate of solar generation.  After creating projects, the user will see graphs on the branch page and displaying carbon payback. The address for the warehouse will be used to caluclated distance drived, combined with the mpg of the vehicle in use to calculate carbon generated driving to and from the site.

* Hope to reach (beyond my initial MVP): Users will be able to list specific models of solar panels and equipment.  The data will be as accurate for each specific model as possible (Although this data isn't always available).


### Target Audience
